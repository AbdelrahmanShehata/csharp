# This script is generated to install necessary Python packages for the application.

# Best practice is to update pip and setuptools first
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools

# Now, install the required packages including 'db'
pip install pathlib urllib3 numpy requests pandas scikit-learn flask sqlalchemy Flask-SQLAlchemy db

# Please note: If 'db' is not the correct package name on PyPI, you will need to find the correct one.
# 'logging', 'datetime', 'os', and 'json' are part of the standard library, so they do not need to be installed.

# Ensure that the actual package name is provided for 'db' if it is available on PyPI.
# If 'db' is a local module or not hosted on PyPI, it should be installed from its source.

# Please verify the correctness of all package names.
